The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used to design, develop, 
test, and deploy software. DevOps plays an important role in modern SDLC by improving collaboration, 
automation, and continuous delivery.

Phases of SDLC include:
1. Planning: define project goals, requirements, and resources.
2. Analysis: study feasibility and gather detailed requirements.
3. Design: create system architecture and design specifications.
4. Implementation/Development: write the actual code and develop features.
5. Testing: ensure the software is functional, reliable, and secure.
6. Deployment: release the software to production.
7. Maintenance: monitor, update, and improve the software over time.

By integrating DevOps practices, organizations can automate testing, streamline deployments, 
and achieve faster, more reliable releases within the SDLC framework.
