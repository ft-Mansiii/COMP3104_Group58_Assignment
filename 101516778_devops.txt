DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) 
to shorten the software development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery of high-quality software. 

Key principles of DevOps include:
- Continuous Integration (CI): frequently merging code changes into a central repository.
- Continuous Deployment (CD): automatically deploying code changes to production.
- Collaboration: developers and operations teams work closely together.
- Automation: using tools to automate testing, deployment, and monitoring.
- Monitoring & Feedback: continuously measuring performance and user feedback to improve software.
